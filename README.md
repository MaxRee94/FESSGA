FESSGA (Finite Element Structure Synthesis Genetic Algorithm) is an evolutionary topology optimization algorithm intended for paleontological research in skull morphology.
It uses principles from natural evolution (genetic recombination, mutation, selection) to produce optimized shapes.
Shapes that have less volume but equal strength as compared to other shapes are considered more optimal.
The Finite Element method is used to evaluate the mechanical response of the shapes to predefined load cases, such as bite forces acting on the skull during feeding.
